Ever heard of Google? No.

Sending a friend request? No.

Looking at Instagram? No.


Husbands, Boyfriends, Crushes, Parents, Friends, Enemies, Customers, Bosses, Employees, Competitors, Metrics, Likes, Shares. Them.

I don't see. I don't know. I don't care. I don't feel. Them.


It's not about Them.

It's about You. It's about Me.

The real You. The real Me.

Just look at the Sky, Stars, Universe, God. One.

Breathe. Taste. Smell. Watch. Feel.


A vision, a truth,

Pure, won't be changed by Them.

No matter who are Them.

No matter what Them do.

It's simple.
