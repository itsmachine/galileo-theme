Valentine, Valentine,
How come you’re so pretentious?


What makes you think I want you?

Your packaged dreams?

Your quantified emotions?

Your bottled eroticism?

Valentine, Valentine…

 

What makes you think she wants you?

Your fabricated hopes?

Your industrialized tastes?

Your capitalized love?

Valentine, Valentine…

 

We have our planet, moon, days…

And today’s like no other…

Her touch has my silly,

My silly has her eyes,

Her eyes has my heart.

 

A Happy Valentine’s Day card?

Valentine, Valentine…

It’s like…Boom Bang Zap Pow…

We control gravity.

What else could we want?
